## `.husky`

Folder which stores github hooks, by default it contains pre-commit hook which prevents push without fixing linter errors.

## `.vscode`

Settings and extensions specific to this project, for Visual Studio Code. See [the editors doc](editors.md#visual-studio-code) for more.

## `docs`

You found me! :wink:

## `src`

Where we keep all our source files.

### `filters`

In this folder you can find app level [filters](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters).

### `migrations`

Folder to store application migrations which will be generated by typeorm.

### `modules`

Where all our NestJS modules lives. See [NestJS modules documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules) for more.

### `shared`

Shared module with global singleton services.

#### `dtos`

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used to define the shape of data that is transferred between different parts of the application.

#### `entities`

Entities represent the data models used by the application, typically corresponding to database tables.

#### `interfaces`

Interfaces define the contracts for the services and other components, ensuring type safety and consistency.

#### `middlewares`

Middlewares are functions that are executed before the route handler, used for tasks such as logging, authentication, etc.

#### `services`

Services contain the business logic of the application and are used to interact with the data layer.

#### `swaggers`

Swagger files for API documentation, providing a way to describe the structure of the APIs.

#### `typeorm`

TypeORM related files, such as custom repositories and decorators.

#### `strategies`

This folder contains various strategies used by TypeORM for different purposes, such as naming conventions and custom behaviors.

##### `snake-naming.strategy.ts`

We are using snake naming strategy for typeorm, so when you will generate migration it automatically will set snake_case column name from entity fields.

#### `utils`

Utility functions and helpers that are used throughout the application.

### `app.module.ts`

The root application module.

## `tests`

Folder where we keep all our e2e test files.

## `.env`

Environment variables which will load before app start and will be stored in `process.env`, (\*) is a env name (development, test, staging, production)

## `.eslintrc.js`

Eslint configuration file, See [the eslint doc](https://eslint.org/) for more.

## `Dockerfile`

Basic Dockerfile configuration to build the app, See [the docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for more.

## `ormconfig.ts`

Typeorm configuration file which is used for migrations and seeds.
